# COMP230  - Pre-production

# Component Proposal 
#### Companion AI - Falcon
## What is the product?
A companion AI that controls the falcon in the game. 
The falcon will:
* sit on the characters arm
* look ahead - search for enemies or resources
* attack/stun enemies
* collect items?
* stretch - how you treat the falcon effects it's behaviour? may not return for awhile if mean, find more items when happy?

## Is there a market? Who is the target audience?
* Market as a companion AI system
* Should be adaptable to different animals
* Don't think a falcon has been used as a companion before

## What are the unique selling points?
* Birds aren't commonly used in games beyond being in the background

## Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
* Depends on how many features
